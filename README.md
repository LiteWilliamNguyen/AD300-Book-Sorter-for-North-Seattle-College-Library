# AD300-Book-Sorter-for-North-Seattle-College-Library

Context:
North Seattle College Library is in the process of updating its digital catalog system to improve accessibility and efficiency in book searches and management. As part of this update, the library needs a new feature that allows sorting books in the digital catalog based on different criteria to help students and faculty find books more easily.

Objective:
Your task as a software developer is to enhance the libraryâ€™s book management system by implementing custom sorting features using the Comparator interface in Java. This will involve creating several comparators to sort books by title, author, and year of publication, as well as a combined sort order for more refined searches.

Background:
The library's current system handles a large collection of books, but lacks flexibility in sorting options, which can hinder users' ability to locate specific books quickly. By creating custom comparators, the library aims to offer a more dynamic and user-friendly experience in navigating the catalog.
